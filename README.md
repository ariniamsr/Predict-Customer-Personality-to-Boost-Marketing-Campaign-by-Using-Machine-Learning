## overview

“ A company can develop rapidly when it knows the behavior of it’s customer personality, so that it can provide better services and benefits to customers who have the potential to become loyal customers. By processing historical marketing campaign data to improve performance and target the right customers, so they can transcat on the company’s platform, from this data insight our focus is to create a cluster prediction model to make it easir for companies to make decisions.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Univariate Analysis

#### Numerical Boxplot

From the boxplot above, it can be seen that there is an outlier that is not too far from the other data. This outlier is located between the upper and lower bounds of the boxplot. This indicates that the outlier is still within the reasonable range of values for the data.

#### Numerical Distplot

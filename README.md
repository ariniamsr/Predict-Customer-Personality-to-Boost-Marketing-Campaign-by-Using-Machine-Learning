## overview

“ A company can develop rapidly when it knows the behavior of it’s customer personality, so that it can provide better services and benefits to customers who have the potential to become loyal customers. By processing historical marketing campaign data to improve performance and target the right customers, so they can transcat on the company’s platform, from this data insight our focus is to create a cluster prediction model to make it easir for companies to make decisions.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Univariate Analysis

#### Numerical Boxplot

From the boxplot above, it can be seen that there is an outlier that is not too far from the other data. This outlier is located between the upper and lower bounds of the boxplot. This indicates that the outlier is still within the reasonable range of values for the data.

#### Numerical Distplot

1. The following variables are normally distributed: 'total_transaksi', NumWebVisitsMonth, NumStorePurchases, NumWebPurchases, NumDealsPurchases, Recency, Year_Birth
2. The following variables are positively skewed: MntCoke, MntFruits, MntMeatProducts, MntFishProducts, MntSweetProducts, MntGoldProds, conversion_rate
3. The following variables are bimodal or have more than 1 mode: total_acc_cmp, jumlah_anak, Kidhome, Teenhome

## Conversion Rate 
### Conversion Rate Based On Age

)<br>
There is a significant relationship between customer age and conversion rate, where adults tend to have a greater impact on conversion rate than teenagers and the elderly. This is because adults are in their active age and have a higher income than teenagers and are more active than the elderly.

### Conversion Rate Based On Jumlah Anak

) <br>
The graph above shows the relationship between conversion rate and the number of children. It can be seen that people with no children tend to have a higher conversion rate than people with one or more children.
